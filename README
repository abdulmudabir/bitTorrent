Test cases considered while .torrent file parsing
1) "torrent file does not start with (first character in .torrent file) a dictionary but starts with: integer, list, string
2) In a dictionary, it does not make sense to map a "key" that is an 'integer' to a value that is a "string", "integer", "list", so a dictionary should never begin with an
integer, or "dictionary". E.g., there shouldn't ever be a case where we'll see something like "di434e ...", neither can there be a list or dictionary as "key" in a dictionary i.e.
there won't be something like "dl1:a2:goe .." or "dd3:foo4:ball ..."
3) No dictionary found inside "info" key, e.g. 4:infol3:egg5:sharkei98776e4:hell
4) Dictionary found inside 'info' key but doesn't have relevant 'bt_info' contents
5) 'length' key inside 'info' dictionary does not have an integer value for e.g, d4:infod6:length5:helloe
6) 'piece length' inside 'info' dictionary should have a 'value' that is a power of 2
    AND 'piece length' should have an integer value i.e. 12:piece lengthi262144e
